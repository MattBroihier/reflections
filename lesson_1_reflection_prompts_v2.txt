How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Didn't have to come through both files line by line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Potentially can't figure out when a bug was introduced into program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You save when you are ready, and think the save makes logical sense
but the downside, is you might not save before there is something that 
causes you to lose work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It always you to logically group a set of changes together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I hope to learn later, but it seems like they would make sense

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  	You can potentially go back to a previous version that was working better

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Automatic saves mean that you won't lose something if you forgot to save.
	Manual committing gives you the power to group the saves into decent logical units.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git is built for software projects and knows that files can be parts of the same project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log lets you see the commits, and then you can use the id's from that
	with get diff to see the differences in versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	if you do break something, you can also go back to an earlier version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Hopefully for version control for Android projects I work on over the next several months
	as I build up my app portfolio
