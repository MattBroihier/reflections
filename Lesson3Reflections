When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  to act as another form of saving and to allow you to work and sync from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It probably depends on whether you are making changes locally or on the
	remote repository and which is the most current.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork is like a clone on github
	you use a fork when you want to clone a github repository on your own github
	account, and then make changes to it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Good to know what the last status was, especially if you end up offline
	without current access to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Could use Google docs and email.  git and github might be harder in 
	terms of learning curve, but might ultimately be more powerful once
	everyone was up to speed with the tools

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	In cases where you want to try something out and decide later whether
	or not to incorporate that into the Master branch
