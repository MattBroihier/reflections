How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It's like a place holder for things that will soon be committed.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	When you're at a point where you've done a logical change, use the git add command to add the file or files to the stage area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	They would be good in cases where you are making a distinct logical change and potentially you'll want to have multiple versions for running

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Not sure why, but being able to visualize the branch structure is very
	helpful.
